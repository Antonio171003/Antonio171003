## 👋 Hi there! I'm Luis Antonio Peñuelas López

I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student at IT Culiacán, currently interning at Wiringbits since January 2024. I specialize in backend and frontend development using Scala 3, React, Play Framework, and Kotlin. I also serve as a teaching assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures, and actively participate in coding competitions like ICPC and Coding Cups.
